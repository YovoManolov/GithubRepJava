	XML DOM : Xml Document object model 
		represents the doc as tree structure 

	w3c world wide web consortium

	XPath used to find info in XML doc contains standard 
		functions . Xpath is the major element in XSLT
		(eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)

	ATTRIBUTE - provides more or additional information 
		about an el than otherwise.
	

	EMPTY TAGS 
	<person></person>
	<person/>


	Advantages of XMLDOM

		traversable / modifiable  structure


	TAG NAMES CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES
	ATTRIBUTE VALUE SHOULD APPEAR WITHIN QUOTES
	WHITE SPACE IS PRESERVED

	Elements contains ;
		another el 
		attribute
		text

XMLParser - convert XMl doc into an XML DOM object which can be written in JS

XSL - expressing style sheets as CSS 

SGML - Standard Generalized markup Language 

< , > & special characters in XML 

graphics can be included in XML by using XLink and XPointer
specifications (IF, JPG, TIFF, PNG, CGM, EPS and SVG.)

conditional statement in XML 

<foo if{DB} = "A">bar</foo>

this can be done by using DTD *Document Type Definition 

<xsl:if test = "@foo = 'bar'">
<xsl:text> Hello, world! </xsl:text>
</xsl:if>


XSLT extensible StyleSheete language transofmation
transform XML to HTML before it is displayed to the browser

Xlink XPointer 

standart way of creating HYPERLINKS in XML files
Xpointer which allows those hyperlinks to point to more 
specific parts of the XML file or document

When XML file is validated against the Document Type Def (DTD), then it is called valid XML

simple el in XML
 	- no attr
 	- doesn't contain other el's 
 	- It cannot be empty 

complex el in XML
 	- it has empty el's
 	- contains other el's 
 	- contain only text 
 	- contain both other el's and text 

XML uses DTD to describe data using data tree 

Three parts of XSL : 
  XSLT - transform XML docs
  XPath - naviagation in XML doc
  XSL-FO - Used for formatting XML document





Types of XML parsers 
non-validating
validating 


XML signiture 
	digital signiture for XML documents
	if the signiture is outside the doc , it is called
	detachted signiture
	if it is inside the XML doc , then it is called Envelopeing
	 signiture

Data island 
 XML Data island is XML embeded into HTML page
 This works only with the internet


DiffGram in XML 
	DiffGram - XML format whitch is used to find current and 
				original version of XML doc 

SAX -- interface processing XMl documents using events



 Defining XML version 
 <?xml version="1.0"/>
