/*A reentrant lock has the same basic behavior as we have seen for
  synchronized blocks, of course there are some extended features!
   -We can make a lock fair: prevent thread starvation Synchronized blocks
   are unfair by default
   - We can check whether the given lock is held or not with reentrant locks
   - We can get the list of threads waiting for the given lock with 
     reentrant locks
   -Synchronized blocks are nicer: we do not need the try- catch-finally block
